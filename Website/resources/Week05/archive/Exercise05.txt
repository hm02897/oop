Exercise - 1

Create a Stack class which holds the Truck values

Dynamically allocate the Stack class

Create a class "Truck" as you did in previous assignment. But this time, it will not have a random number of boxes as done previously.

Take input from the user to fill all the attributes of the truck (all trucks will be dynamically created)

Keep adding truck entries till the user chooses not to.

Display all the entries

Deallocate the Stack class

Exercise - 2

Recreate Exercise - 1, but this time the trucks hold a dynamic array of Boxes

Ensure that there are no memory leaks!!!!
