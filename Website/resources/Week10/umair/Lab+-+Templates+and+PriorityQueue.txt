You have been given the code for priority queue

Your task is to convert this queue into a template class

Now recall your assignment number 3 where you were drawing rectangles

change the assignment code such that you now draw a right angle triangle and an isosceles triangle
instead of points and lines. right angled triangles have the highest priority, then isosceles and finally
rectangles.

now when you right click a shape, only that shape should disappear
