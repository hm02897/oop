Class Exercise 01:
------------------

Define 3 structures namely Rectangle, Circle and Triangle.

Define their attributes

Define their constructors

Define a Function called Area that returns the area of the shapes

Once completed, change all the structures into classes and make corrections to the code so that it works with the classes.

Class Exercise 02:
------------------

Create a structure called Course, that has the following information

Name:		Object Oriented Programming & Design Methodolgy
Code:		CS-224
id:			224
credits:	4

similarly you can define more courses like this so create an appropriate structure with appropriate attributes with correct data types.

Then define a structure of a student that has the following information:

Name:		John Doe
id:			jd1101
year:		Sophomore

It should have an array of courses with length 5

You should be able to read the course data from a file and create an array of courses of dynamic length that stores that data.

It should also do the same with student data.

You will then assign random courses to students in such a way that no courses is repeated.

Once done, change all the structures to classes and change the code accordingly.
